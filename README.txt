This is a work in progress Magic: The Gathering AI project from scratch. 

The idea is to build everything, from the Gameboard, to the rule system, to server holding the cards and the decks. 
Why? I have no idea. It was origionally for class but now I'm using it to learn everything from networking to thread management in C.

Hope my pain can be used somewhere.
