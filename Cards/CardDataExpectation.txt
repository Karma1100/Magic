How could one quanitfy all modifyers of ever card in a set?
Well, i would create flags for each.

There is basic data, such as card type, mana cost and all of the basic card info.But how can one break it down such that the gameboard can rule check for the unique states of all of the cards?



create flags for all unique scenairo. each set has their own unique functions, but all cards genearlly have the same kind of game modifyers. 

As such, create a general flaging system and then implement another system to deal with the unique functions. this way for other set implimentations, all one would need to do is create a new unique function flag for that set. 

the cards would then be broken down into these lists ->
Deck list: All cards in a Jumpstart deck, or other decks(for now its just for jumpstart)
Card Master list: This would hold all of the cards possible in the sets, with generic data and a link to a unique card function list
Unique function list: this would be where cards with unique functions game actions would exist. the cards ID, its primary key, would link the master and unique lists togeather with functions dealing with card interactions handeling all of this. 

ie: 
DeckList:
	id | deck name | description

	1 'Aang' 'White Deck'

MasterList:
	Card Name | Card Type | Keyword Code | Power | Toughness | Unique Abilities | Sub-Class code | Cost Code
	Card Type Code:
		Lc -> Legendary Creature
		C -> Creature

	Keyword Code:
		Fy -> Flying
		Fl -> Flash
		Ds -> Double Strike
		
	SubclassCode : 
		A -> Ally
		B -> Bat
		Cz -> Citizen
		Hu -> Human
		Le -> Lemur
		Wa -> Warrior
	
	Cost code : 
		M0W1 -> 0 Regular Mana, 1 white mana 
	
	omo, Rambunctious Rascal' 'Legendary Creature' {'flying'} 1 1 1 'lemur bat ally' 1 2

Unique Function List:
	Card Name | Trigger Type(integer will be enum in code) | Effect Code(Enum will be described in code)  | Text to describe | 
	
	trigger list:
		M1 -> mana cost 1
		M1W2 -> mana 1 white 2
		M0W2 -> 0 Mana 2 white mana
		MX -> Payed by mana cost X
		OE -> On enter
		OD -> On death
		SC -> Sacrifice card
		SXC -> Sacrifice X card
		
		etc etc. This list will be long
	
	
	Effect Code:
		Da damage | #d amount of damage | # of things hit(X is variable, A is all) |card status Ta tapped Un untapped | kind of things hit (C creatures Ar artifacts etc) | ownership , Op opponent Ax all  Ow Owned 
		En enhance | #P number for Power | #T number for toughness | #kinds of things hit (C creatures A artifacts etc) | ownership , O opponent A all M mine
		Cd draw card | #c number of cards 
		Cs  discard cards | #cards
		Cg place cards in graveyard | #number
		Ce Exile Cards | #number
		
		To Token Creation | #number of tokens | kind of tokens (Color, subclass, subclass, subclass, ...)| #P power | #T toughness 
			If its a treasure token, kind of token = T, then P and T are non existant and needs to be coded. 
			Likewise all tokens need to be created and dealt with. 
			W = white
			R = red
			B = blue
			G = Green
			Bl = black
			subclass = subclass used for master_list  		
	  
		Da1d1CO -> Deals 1 Damage to Opponent creature
		Da1d2CO -> Deals 1 Damage to 2 Opponent creatures
		Da2d3CO -> Deals 2 Damage to 3 Opponent creatures
		Da3d4CO -> Deals 3 Damage to 4 Opponent creatures
		Da2d5CO -> Deals 2 Damage to 5 Opponent creatures
		DaXdXCO -> Deals X Damage to X Opponent Creatures (given by gameboard) (logic check needed for this code)
		Da20dACO -> Deals 20 Damage to all Opponent creatures
		Da1d2TCO -> Deals 1 Damage to 2 Tapped creatures that the opponent controlls 

		En1P2T1CM -> Enchance 1 power 2 toughness to 1 creature that is mine	
		




		combo code:
		Da and En are the start of a new Code, more will come soon but for now
		Da2d1COEn1P2T1AM -> deals 2 damage to 1 creature that the opponent controlls and enchance 1 artifact by 1/2 that I control 

'Momo, Rambunctious Rascal' OE | Da1TCO | 4 | deals 4 damage to 1 tapped creature that the oppponent controlls   
 	
Special Class:
	Color -> this is a spefication, its the color of whatever comes after it. In the case of cost, where M# is prefaced, then its a cost descriptor. If infront of subclass, then the card is that color. ie, WHuWaA -> White Human Warrior Ally
